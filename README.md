# Hey!

I am a self-taught programmer now getting a degree in Computer Science and Games Technology. I am enthusiastic about lower level programming and can suffer web development when I have to. 
Over the next few years I would like to learn more about low level graphics, compilers, and optimisations. 
<!-- I started making games when I was [9 years old](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Dot32/), and 
<!--A 19 year old currently learning Rust. A passionate programmer and artist [since I was 9 years old.](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Dot32/) -->
